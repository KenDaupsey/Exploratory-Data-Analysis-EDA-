Exploratory Data Analysis Example 4

This repository showcases an example of exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python, focusing on a dataset containing academic performance metrics and demographic information.

Overview:

The analysis begins by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset from a GitHub URL. Basic information about the dataset, including the first few rows, data types, and summary statistics, is displayed to gain insights into its structure and content.

Data Visualization:

Visualizations are employed to explore relationships and distributions within the dataset. A pairplot is used to visualize relationships between numerical variables, while a correlation matrix heatmap provides insights into variable correlations.

Distribution and Outliers:

Histograms and boxplots are utilized to examine the distribution of numerical variables and identify potential outliers. Each numerical variable's distribution and any outliers are visualized to understand the data's spread and identify anomalies.

Categorical Variables:

Countplots are generated to visualize the frequency distribution of categorical variables. Additionally, label encoding is applied to convert categorical variables into numerical format, facilitating further analysis and modeling.

For detailed implementation and code snippets, please refer to the provided Jupyter Notebook.

Note: This example serves as an educational resource and illustrates fundamental techniques in exploratory data analysis.
