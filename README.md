Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Examples
Welcome to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) repository! This project provides four different examples of EDA techniques to help you uncover insights and patterns in your datasets. Whether you're new to data analysis or looking to refine your skills, these examples offer a range of analyses suitable for every level of analytics learning.

Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in the data analysis process. It involves examining and summarizing the main characteristics of a dataset to gain insights, identify anomalies, and guide further analysis.

Examples

Example 1: Basic EDA
Description: This example covers the basics of EDA, including loading the dataset, displaying basic information, summary statistics, and visualizing distributions.
Techniques: Summary statistics, histograms, box plots, and pair plots.
Target Audience: Beginners in data analysis.

Example 2: Correlation Analysis
Description: This example focuses on exploring relationships between variables in the dataset.
Techniques: Correlation matrix, heatmap, and scatter plots.
Target Audience: Users interested in understanding the correlation between different features.

Example 3: Outlier Detection
Description: This example demonstrates how to identify outliers within the dataset.
Techniques: Box plots and visual inspection.
Target Audience: Users looking to identify and handle outliers in their data.

Example 4: Categorical Analysis
Description: This example explores categorical variables within the dataset, including frequency counts and visualizations.
Techniques: Count plots and cross-tabulations.
Target Audience: Users interested in analyzing categorical data and understanding relationships between variables.

Getting Started
To get started with these examples, follow these steps:

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
